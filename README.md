# ML-Diabetes-Prediction-Project
The diabetes prediction project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on health features like age, BMI, blood glucose level, hypertension, and HbA1c level. The dataset is analyzed, cleaned, and processed to handle missing values, outliers, and class imbalance. Various classification models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and others, are trained and evaluated to determine the best-fit model. The project aims to identify key risk factors and provide a reliable tool for predicting diabetes, aiding in early detection and better management of the disease.
