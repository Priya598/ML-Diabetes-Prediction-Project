# ML-Diabetes-Prediction-Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health factors, including age, BMI, blood glucose level, and HbA1c level. By analyzing a dataset of patient records, we seek to identify key indicators associated with diabetes and develop a predictive model. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with insights that can facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and promoting preventive care strategies.
